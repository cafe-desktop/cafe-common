NAME
  mate-doc-common - include the standard user documentation build files
SYNOPSIS
  mate-doc-common
DESCRIPTION
  This script is used by mate-autogen to include the standard user
  documentation build files in a MATE package.
  
  To automatically include the standard user documentation build files (omf.make
  and xmldocs.make) in you package, set USE_COMMON_DOC_BUILD=yes in autogen.sh
  before calling the macros/autogen.sh script.

  When porting applications across to use this feature, ensure that all of the
  references to xmldocs.make are to $(top_srcdir)/xmldocs.make in the appropriate
  Makefile.am files. Some modules assume that xmldocs.make is in another
  directory (like docs/ or something).
OPTIONS
  --help      Display the help of the script.
  --version   Show the script version.
  --copy      Copy files instead of make symlinks.
